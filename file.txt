Im happy I created one file in local rep and moved the same to centralized as well!!

testing this file by performing edit operation

I have edited the file in remote repository and commited the changes in the remote rep

to do the above task I uesd the pull command!!

Now planning to see the above two line change in centralised repository.

To check this we need to use the push command so that the local repository chages gets reflects in remote repository.
